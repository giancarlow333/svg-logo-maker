# SVG Logo Maker

A Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file.

## Installation

**Please note:** You must have Node.js installed on your computer to run this app.  To install it, please consult [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for details.

Once you have Node.js installed on your computer, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo into a folder on your computer.
2. From the command line, run ``npm install`` to install all needed packages.  (You only have to do this the first time you run the app!)
3. Invoke the app using the command ``node index.js``.

## Usage

## Sources

* Some code was copied from my first Node.js project, the [Readme Generator](https://github.com/giancarlow333/readme-generator).
* Before I did this project (a class project), I did another SVG generation project, the [Solar System Diagrammer](https://github.com/giancarlow333/solar-system-diagrammer).  Some code from that project **may have made its way here??**.
